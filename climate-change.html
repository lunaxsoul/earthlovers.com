            <h3> What Is Climate Change
                <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sunâ€™s activity or large volcanic eruptions.
                </p>

            <h3> Example
                <p>
                    Global warming is one of the most prominent examples of climate change. Average temperatures around the world have been rising, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves.

            <h3> People Experience
                <p>
                Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries</p>

    <h1>Why This Issue is Important?
        <p>
            Climate change refers to significant and lasting changes in the Earth's climate patterns over an extended period. These changes can manifest in various ways, impacting different regions differently. Here are some examples of climate change effects!

                <h3>Rising Temperatures</h3>
                <p>Global warming is one of the most prominent examples of climate change. Average temperatures around the world have been rising, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves</p>
            </div>

                <img src="melting.jpg" width="400" height="275">
                <h3> Melting Ice & Glaciers </h3>
                <p>The warming climate is causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt at an accelerated rate, contributing to rising sea levels. This affects coastal communities and habitats for polar animals</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="why-col">
                <img src="rise.jpg">
                <h3> Sea Level Rise </h3>
                <p>As ice melts and water expands due to warming temperatures, sea levels are rising. This leads to increased coastal flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources</p>
            </div>

                <h3> Extreme Weather</h3>
                <p>Climate change can intensify extreme weather events such as hurricanes, cyclones, droughts, floods, and wildfires. These events can cause widespread destruction, loss of life, and economic impacts</p>
