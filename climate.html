            <h3> What Is Climate Change
                <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sunâ€™s activity or large volcanic eruptions.

                <p>
                    Global warming is one of the most prominent examples of climate change. Average temperatures around the world have been rising, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves.

    <h1>Why This Issue is Important?
        <p>
            Climate change refers to significant and lasting changes in the Earth's climate patterns over an extended period. These changes can manifest in various ways, impacting different regions differently. Here are some examples of climate change effects!

                <h3>Rising Temperatures</h3>
                <p>Global warming is one of the most prominent examples of climate change. Average temperatures around the world have been rising, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves</p>

                <h3> Melting Ice & Glaciers </h3>
                <p>The warming climate is causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt at an accelerated rate, contributing to rising sea levels. This affects coastal communities and habitats for polar animals</p>

                <h3> Sea Level Rise </h3>
                <p>As ice melts and water expands due to warming temperatures, sea levels are rising. This leads to increased coastal flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources</p>

                <h3> Extreme Weather</h3>
                <p>Climate change can intensify extreme weather events such as hurricanes, cyclones, droughts, floods, and wildfires. These events can cause widespread destruction, loss of life, and economic impacts</p>

<section class="reason">
    <h1>Reason Why We Should Aware And Take Parts</h1>
        <img src="you.jpg">
        <p>
            Urgent action is imperative to combat the far-reaching effects of climate change, which endanger biodiversity, ecosystems, and human well-being. Rising temperatures, erratic weather patterns, and habitat destruction pose significant threats to the stability of ecosystems and the survival of various species. Additionally, climate change exacerbates social and economic inequalities, disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities and increasing risks of displacement, food and water insecurity, and adverse health outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, climate change jeopardizes global food and water security, public health, and economic stability. Erratic weather patterns and extreme weather events disrupt agricultural productivity, exacerbate water scarcity, and contribute to the spread of diseases. Inaction on climate change entails substantial economic costs, including significant losses from climate-related disasters and hindrances to long-term growth and prosperity. Thus, urgent action is imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance climate resilience, and foster sustainable development.
        </p>
        <p>
            To address these challenges, urgent action is needed. We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve energy, promote sustainable transportation, minimize waste, protect and restore ecosystems, and raise awareness. Transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and adopting sustainable practices are crucial steps. By promoting sustainable transportation and minimizing waste, we can further mitigate emissions. Protecting ecosystems and educating about climate change are essential for a sustainable future. Protecting our planet starts with you!
